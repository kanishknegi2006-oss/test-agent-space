## 🚀 Overview

AgentSpace is a modern, scalable, and modular AI agent marketplace and execution platform. Designed with a GitHub-like experience, it empowers developers and users to explore, create, and interact with autonomous AI agents. Whether you need a code debugger, a legal summarizer, or a creative writing assistant, AgentSpace provides the infrastructure to run, fork, and evaluate agents securely.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🛒 **Agent Marketplace:** Explore a rich directory of high-quality AI agents organized by categories (Coding, Business, Career, Legal, etc.). Filter by Top Rated or Most Stars.
* 🛠️ **Auto Repo Builder:** Don't want to write code? Generate comprehensive agent configurations, prompt templates, and `README` files entirely from natural language descriptions using Gemini AI.
* ⚔️ **Battle Mode:** Compare two agents side-by-side. Provide a single prompt and watch how different agents handle the specific task, evaluating their performance, speed, and accuracy in real-time.
* 🏃 **Secure Execution:** Run interactive, chat, and input-output agents directly from their repository pages with real inputs and structured outputs.
* 🐙 **GitHub-style Ecosystem:** Every agent has its own repository featuring Live Demos, READMEs, Issues, Pull Requests, `agent.yaml` Configs, and SDK usage examples.
* 👤 **Developer Profiles:** Showcase your created agents, track your contributions, and build a following in the AgentSpace ecosystem.
